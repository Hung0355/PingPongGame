- KIT STM32F4 Discovery for STM32F429 MCU.
2. DESCRIPTION
- Firstly, the system is in an initial balanced state.
- The player will lower and raise the KIT to perform ball juggling actions, during which the LCD screen simulates the state of the ball being lifted and dropped.
- The player's objective is to raise the KIT at the right moment when the ball is falling, hit it against the "paddle," and bounce it back up. The player scores points, and the green light flashes once.
- If the player lifts correctly, depending on the accuracy, the ball will bounce up at different speeds.
- If the player misses the lift, the ball will fall, resulting in GAME OVER. The red light turns on and remains on until reset.
